                <p><strong>The <em>service-oriented architecture</em> (SOA) style builds applications by combining functionalities packaged as <em>programmatically accessible services</em></strong>. SOA aims to achieve interoperability between distributed
                  services, which may not even be implemented using the same programming language. A common way to implement SOA is through the use of <em>XML web services</em> where the web is used as the medium for the services to interact, and XML
                  is used as the language of communication between service providers and service users.</p>

                    ‘eBookShop’ web application can be developed that allows HSBC customers to buy merchandise from Amazon and pay for them using HSBC credit cards. Because both Amazon and HSBC services follow the SOA architecture, their web services
                    can be reused by the web application, even if all three systems use different programming platforms.</p><img src="/website/book/architecture/architecturalStyles/serviceOriented/what/images/amazonWebServices.png" height="280">

                <p><strong>Based on the order in which components are integrated, incremental integration can be done in three ways.</strong></p>
                <p><strong><em>Top-down</em> integration: higher-level components are integrated before bringing in the lower-level components.</strong> One advantage of this approach is that higher-level problems can be discovered early. One disadvantage
                  is that this requires the use of
                  <trigger for="pop:topdown-stub">stubs</trigger> in place of lower level components until the real lower-level components are integrated to the system. Otherwise, higher-level components cannot function as they depend on lower level ones.</p>

                    <div>
                      <p><strong>Stub</strong>: A stub has the same interface as the component it replaces, but its implementation is so simple that it is unlikely to have any bugs. It mimics the responses of the component, but only for the a limited set
                        of predetermined inputs. That is, it does not know how to respond to any other inputs. Typically, these mimicked responses are hard-coded in the stub rather than computed or retrieved from elsewhere, e.g. from a database.</p>

                <p><strong><em>Bottom-up</em> integration: the reverse of top-down integration.</strong> Note that when integrating lower level components,
                  <tooltip content="additional code written to provide inputs to a component via an API">drivers</tooltip> may be needed to test the integrated components <span class="dimmed"> because the UI may not be integrated yet</span>, just like top-down integration needs stubs.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Sandwich</em> integration: a mix of the top-down and the bottom-up approaches.</strong> The idea is to do both top-down and bottom-up so as to 'meet' in the middle.</p>

                            <p>There can be many acceptable answers to this question. But any good strategy should consider at least some of the below.</p>

                              <li>Because <code>HospitalUI</code> will be developed early, it’s OK to integrate it early, using stubs, rather than wait for the rest of the system to finish. (i.e. a top-down integration is suitable for <code>HospitalUI</code>)</li>
                              <li>Because <code>HospitalFacade</code> is unlikely to have a lot of business logic, it may not be worth to write stubs to test it (i.e. a bottom-up integration is better for <code>HospitalFacade</code>).</li>
                              <li>Because <code>IO_Helper</code> is to be reused from an earlier project, we can finish it early. This is especially suitable since there are many classes that use it. Therefore <code>IO_Helper</code> can be integrated with
                                the dependent classes in bottom-up fashion.</li>
                              <li>Because <code>OutPatient</code> class may be delayed, we may have to integrate <code>PatientMgr</code> using a stub.</li>
                              <li><code>TypeA</code>, <code>TypeB</code>, and <code>TypeC</code> seem to be tightly coupled. It may be a good idea to test them together.</li>

                    <p><strong>Abstraction</strong>: Abstraction is a technique for dealing with complexity. It works by establishing a level of complexity on which a person interacts with the system, suppressing the more complex details below the current

                  </div>

                <p>Most programs are written to solve complex problems involving large amounts of intricate details. It is impossible to deal with all these details at the same time. The guiding principle of abstraction stipulates that we capture only details
                  that are relevant to the current perspective or the task at hand.</p>
                <p><strong>Ignoring lower level data items and thinking in terms of bigger entities is called <em>data abstraction</em>.</strong></p>
                <tip-box>
                  <p>📦 Within a certain software component, we might deal with a <em>user</em> data type, while ignoring the details contained in the user data item such as <em>name</em>, and <em>date of birth</em>. These details have been ‘abstracted away’
                    as they do not affect the task of that software component.</p>

                <p><strong><em>Control abstraction</em> abstracts away details of the actual control flow to focus on tasks at a simplified level.</strong></p>

                <p>While it is possible to isolate the functionalities of a software system into modules, there is no way to remove interaction between modules. When modules interact with each other, coupling naturally increases. Consequently, it is harder
                  to localize any changes to the software system. The Open-Close Principle aims to alleviate this problem.</p>

                    <code>Sort</code>, and <code>Reset</code>, the <code>CommandQueue</code> can now perform delete commands without modifying its code at all. That is, its behavior was extended without having to modify its code. Hence, it was open to

                <p><strong>Integration testing is not simply a repetition of the unit test cases but run using the actual dependencies</strong> (instead of the stubs used in unit testing). Instead, integration tests are additional test cases that focus on
                  the interactions between the parts.</p>
                <tip-box>
                  <p>📦 Suppose a class <code>Car</code> uses classes <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code>. Here is how you would go about doing pure integration tests:</p>
                  <p>a) First, unit test <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code>.<br> b) Next, unit test <code>Car</code> in isolation of <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code>, <mark>using stubs for <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code></mark>.<br>                    c) After that, do an integration test for <code>Car</code> using it together with the <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code> classes to ensure the <code>Car</code> integrates properly with the <code>Engine</code> and the <code>Wheel</code>.</p>
                </tip-box>

                <tip-box>
                  <p>📦 Here's how a hybrid unit+integration approach could be applied to the same example used above:</p>
                  <p>(a) First, unit test <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code>.<br><s>(b) Next, unit test <code>Car</code> in isolation of <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code>, using stubs for <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code>.</s><br>                    (c) After that, do an integration test for <code>Car</code> using it together with the <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code> classes to ensure the <code>Car</code> integrates properly with the <code>Engine</code> and the <code>Wheel</code>.
                    <mark>This step should include test cases that are meant to test the unit <code>Car</code></mark> (i.e. test cases used in the step (b) of the example above) as well as test cases that are meant to test the integration of <code>Car</code>                    with <code>Wheel</code> and <code>Engine</code> (i.e. pure integration test cases used of the step (c) in the example above).</p>
                  <p>💡 Note that you no longer need stubs for <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code>. The downside is that <code>Car</code> is never tested in isolation of its dependencies. Given that its dependencies are already unit tested, the risk
                    of bugs in <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code> affecting the testing of <code>Car</code> can be considered minimal.</p>

                <p>If a software product has a GUI component, all product-level testing (i.e. the types of testing mentioned above) need to be done using the GUI. However, <strong>testing the GUI is much harder than testing the CLI (command line interface) or API</strong>,
                  for the following reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Most GUIs can support a large number of different operations, many of which can be performed in any arbitrary order.</li>
                  <li>GUI operations are more difficult to automate than API testing. Reliably automating GUI operations and automatically verifying whether the GUI behaves as expected is harder than calling an operation and comparing its return value with
                    an expected value. Therefore, automated regression testing of GUIs is rather difficult.</li>
                  <li>The appearance of a GUI (and sometimes even behavior) can be different across platforms and even environments. For example, a GUI can behave differently based on whether it is minimized or maximized, in focus or out of focus, and in
                    a high resolution display or a low resolution display.</li>
                </ul><img src="/website/book/testing/testAutomation/testingGuis/images/diagram.png" height="120">
                <p></p>
                <p><strong>One approach to overcome the challenges of testing GUIs is to minimize logic aspects in the GUI.</strong> Then, bypass the GUI to test the rest of the system using automated API testing. While this still requires the GUI to be
                  tested manually, the number of such manual test cases can be reduced as most of the system has been tested using automated API testing.</p>
                <p><strong>There are testing tools that can automate GUI testing.</strong></p>
