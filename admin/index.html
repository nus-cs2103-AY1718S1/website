      <p><strong>Attendance</strong>: Attendance for the <mark>first lecture is compulsory</mark>.</p>
      <p><strong>Webcast</strong>: All lectures will be webcast. However, some things are not captured well in the webcast recording. You are advised to treat the webcast as a 'backup' for you to catch up anything missed during the lecture.</p>
      <p><strong>Handouts</strong>: There are no handouts. All learning materials are organized around learning outcomes (not lectures or topics), are given in Web format, and can be found in the <a href="/website/book/index.html">Textbook</a> section

          <p><strong>We want to move you away from 'hand holding' and make you learn how to solve problems on your own.</strong> This is a vital survival skill in the industry and it needs practice.</p>
          <p>Whether it is a technical problem <span class="dimmed">(e.g. error when using the IDE)</span> or a doubt about a concept <span class="dimmed">(e.g. what is the difference between scripted testing and exploratory testing?)</span><strong>we the teaching team are happy to work <em>with</em> you when you look for a solution/answer, but we do not do it <em>for</em> you.</strong>            We discourage unconditional direct help from tutors because we want you to learn to help yourself. Yes, we believe in ‘tough love’😝.</p>
          <p>The question you should always ask yourself is, 'how do I solve this problem if the lecturer/tutors are not around to help me?'</p><img src="/website/admin/images/the good reasons to get home early.png" width="300">
          <p>Note: This guide is mostly about getting tech help, but it also applies to getting clarifications on module topics too. e.g. what is the difference between <em>refactoring</em> and <em>rewriting</em>?</p>
          <p>What not to do:</p>
          <p>When faced with a technical problem or a doubt about a concept, don'f fire off an email lecturer/tutor immediately after you encounter a problem or a doubt, unless it is something only the lecturer/tutor is supposed to know. Instead, here are
            some things you can do:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Check what is given</strong>: Check if the problem/concept has been discussed in the lectures, text book, or the list of resources given to you. Yes it is easier for you to write an email to the tutor/lecturer instead, but that shouldn't
                be your default behavior. We know that sometimes it is difficult to find stuff in the resources we have provided. But you should try first.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Search</strong>: It is very likely the answer already exists somewhere in the cyberspace. Almost every programming-related question has been answered in places like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>. Don't give
                an opportunity for someone to ask you to <a href="http://www.jibble.org/stfw/">STFW</a>.<br> Pay attention to the error message you encounter. Sometimes it also contains hints as to how to fix the problem. Even if not, a web search on
                the error message is a good starting point.  <br><img src="/website/admin/images/how to google it.png" width="460" height="268"></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Ask peers</strong>:</p>
              <p>Ask your team members.</p>
              <p>Ask classmates using the module forum or the slack channel. Even if you figured out one way to solve a problem, discussing it on a public forum might lead you to better ways of solving it, and will help other classmates who are facing similar
                problems too. If you are really shy to ask questions in the forum, you may use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vf2TjVhASq_u1_kQEEyURE5fTeBg6iKwGQDJUxYiAmg/viewform">this form</a> to submit your question anonymously which we will

                <p><em>Rubber duck debugging</em> is an informal term used in software engineering to refer to a method of debugging code. The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a

              <p>Here are some tips for posting help request:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>PLEASE search for existing answers before you post your question in those public forums; You don't want to appear as a 'clueless' or 'too lazy to do your research' person in a public forum.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Learn to isolate the problem. &quot;My code doesn't work&quot; isn't going to help even if you post the whole code online. Others don't have time to go through all of your code. Isolate the part that doesn't work and strip it down to
                    the bare minimum that is enough reproduce the error. Sometimes, this process actually helps you to figure out the problem yourself. If not, at least it increases the chance of someone else being able to help you.<br>
                    <tip-box type="tip">
                      How to isolate problematic code? Delete code (one bit at a time) that is confirmed as not related to the problem. Do that until you can still reproduce the problem with the least amount of code remaining.
                    </tip-box>
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Generalize the problem. &quot;How to write tasks to a text file using Java&quot; is too specific to what you are working on. You are more likely to find help if you post a thread called (or search for) &quot;How to write to a file using
                    Java&quot;.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Explain well. Conversations via online forums take time. If you post everything that is relevant to your problem, your chances of getting an answer in the first try is higher. If others have to ask you more questions before they can
                    help you, it will take longer. But this doesn't mean you dump too much information into the thread either.<br>

          <li>🚫 <em>What is coupling?</em> - Such questions will not be entertained. <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason</strong>: This question implies you haven’t done what you could to learn the topic in concern.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </panel>
      <p></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No leading from the front</strong>: Tutors are not expected to lead your project effort. They will not tell you how to do project tasks or when to do project tasks. You have to figure those out yourselves. But tutors will give you feedback
          on how you are doing (or have done) project tasks so that you can improve further.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Timing/venue:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Please refer to the <a href="/website/schedule/index.html">Schedule page</a> for further details on each tutorial.</li>
        <li>You are expected to arrive on time. <mark>Punctuality is considered for participation marks.</mark></li>
        <li>You may leave the class 15 minutes before the hour if you have another class right after. There is no need to wait till the tutor dismisses you. However, inform the tutor (as a courtesy) before leaving if you leave before the class is dismissed.</li>
        <li>Please make sure you <mark>vacate the table 5 minutes before the hour</mark> so that the next group can start on time.</li>
        <li>In the past many students have suggested to increase the tutorial duration because 1 hour is barely enough to get through all weekly LOs. Increasing the tutorial time is not possible due to lack of venues and tutors. Instead, let's try to make
          the best of the one hour available by coming well prepared and starting on time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Grading:</strong></p>
      <p>Tutorials are not graded. However, your conduct will be reviewed by team members and the tutor which will determine your participation marks.</p>

          <p><strong>Constraint-Morph</strong>: The final product should be a result of morphing the given code base. i.e. enhance and/or evolve the given code to arrive at the new software. However, you are allowed to replace all existing code with new
            code, as long as it is done incrementally. <span class="dimmed">e.g. one feature/component at a time</span><br><span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> To ensure your code has a decent quality level from the start.</span></p>

          <p><strong>Constraint-Incremental</strong>: The product needs to be developed incrementally over the project duration (week 6-13). While it is fine to do less in some weeks and more in other weeks, a reasonably consistent delivery rate is expected.
            For example, it is not acceptable to do the entire project over the recess week and do almost nothing for the remainder of the semester. <span class="dimmed"> Reasons: <a href="http://1.To">1.To</a> simulate a real project where you have to work on a code base over a long period, possibly with breaks in the middle. 2.

Some minimal use of mouse is OK (e.g. to click the minimize button), but the primary input should be command-driven.
<ul><li>Mouse actions should have keyboard alternatives.</li><li>Typing is preferred over key combinations.

        <div>
          <p>Given their lightweight nature, <strong>user stories are quite handy for recording requirements during early requirements gathering</strong>.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>💡 Here are some tips for using user stories for early stages of requirement gathering:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Define the <em>target user</em>:</strong><br> Decide your target user's profile (e.g. a student, office worker, programmer, sales person) and work patterns (e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer with others?).
                A clear understanding of the target user will help when deciding the importance of a user story. You can even give this user a name. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Target user Jean is a university student studying in a non-IT field. She interacts with a lot of people due to her involvement in university clubs/societies. ...</span></li>
              <li><strong>Define the <em>problem scope</em>:</strong> Decide that exact problem you are going to solve for the target user. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Help Jean keep track of all her school contacts</span></li>
              <li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong><br> Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for the target users.</li>
              <li><strong>Don't go into too much details:</strong><br> For example, consider this user story: <code>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.</code><br>                When discussing this user story, don't worry about what tasks should be considered <em>needs my attention most at the present time</em>. Those details can be worked out later.</li>
              <li><strong>Don't be biased by preconceived product ideas:</strong><br> When you are at the stage of identifying user needs, clear your mind of ideas you have about what your end product will look like.</li>
              <li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong><br> When gathering requirements, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil it. Implementation
                details can be discussed later. If a user story turns out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always omit it from the implementation plan.</li>
            </ul>
          </tip-box>
        </div>
      </modal>
      <panel header="%%:package: User Story examples (from a different product)%%">
        <p><code>As a user I can add a task by specifying a task description only, so that I can record tasks that need to be done ‘some day’.</code><br><code>As a user I can find upcoming tasks, so that I can decide what needs to be done soon.</code><br><code>As a user I can delete a task, so that I can get rid of tasks that I no longer care to track.</code><br><code>As a new user I can view more information about a particular command, so that I can learn how to use various commands.</code><br><code>As an advanced user I can use shorter versions of a command, so that type a command faster.</code></p>

      <p>Suggested workflow:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Take one use story at a time and get team member opinions about it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Based on the team consensus, put the story (i.e. the piece of paper) onto one of these three piles:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>Must-Have</code> : The product will be practically useless to the target user without this feature.</li>
            <li><code>Nice-To-Have</code> : The target user can benefit from this user story significantly but you are not certain if you'll have time to implement it.</li>
            <li><code>Not-Useful</code> : No significant benefit to the target user, or does not fit into the product vision.</li>
          </ul>

      <p>Update the following pages of the Developer Guide:</p>

                            <p>Consider a simple movie ticket vending machine application. Every week, the theatre staff will enter the weekly schedule as well as ticket price for each show. A customer sees the schedule and the ticket price displayed at
                              the machine. There is a slot to insert money, a keypad to enter a code for a movie, a code for the show time, and the number of tickets. A display shows the customer's balance inside the machine. A customer may choose to
                              cancel a transaction before pressing the “buy” button. Printed tickets can be collected from a slot at the bottom of the machine. The machine also displays messages such as &quot;Please enter more money”, “Request fewer tickets&quot;
                              or &quot;SOLD OUT!”. Finally, a &quot;Return Change&quot; button allows the customer to get back his unspent money.</p>

                            <p>The system is to be used by Testers, Programmers and System Administrators. Only an administrator can create new users and assign tasks to programmers. Any tester can create a bug report, as well as set the status of a bug
                              report as ‘closed’. Only a programmer can set the state of a bug report to ‘fixed’, but a programmer cannot set the status of a bug report to ‘closed’. Each tester is assigned just one task at a time. A task involves testing
                              of a particular component for a particular customer. Tester must document the bugs they find. Each bug is given a unique identifier. Other information recorded about the bug is component id, severity, date and time reported,
                              programmer who is assigned to fix it, date fixed, date retested and date closed. The system keeps track of which bugs are assigned to which programmer at any given time. It should be able to generate reports on the number
                              of bugs found, fixed and closed e.g. number of bugs per component and per customer; number of bugs found by a particular tester ; number of bugs awaiting to be fixed; number of bugs awaiting to be retested; number of bugs

                              <p><strong>Explanation</strong>: The given description contains information not relevant to use case modeling. Furthermore, the description is not enough to complete the use case diagram All these are realities of real projects.
                                However, the process of trying to create this use case diagram prompts us to investigate issues such as:</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li>Is ‘edit bug report’ a use case or editing the bug report is covered by other use cases such as those for setting the status of bug reports? If it is indeed a separate use case, who are the actors of that use case?</li>
                                <li>Does ‘assign task’ simply means ‘assign bug report’ or is there any other type of tasks?</li>
                                <li>There was some mention about Customers and Components. Does the system have to support use cases for creating and maintaining details about those entities? For example, should we have a ‘create customer record’ use case?</li>
                                <li>Which actors can perform the ‘generate report’ use case? Are reports generated automatically by the system at a specific time or generated ‘on demand’ when users request to view them? Do we have to treat different types
                                  of reports as different use cases (in case some types of reports are restricted to some types of users)? The above diagram assumes (just for illustration) that the report is generated on demand and only the system admin
                                  can generate any report.</li>

                    <p>Also note that it is not useful to mention events such as power failures or system crashes as extensions because the system cannot function beyond such catastrophic failures.</p><img src="/website/book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/details/images/extension.png"

                    <p>In use case diagrams you can use the <code>&lt;&lt; extend &gt;&gt;</code> arrows to show extensions. Note the direction of the arrow is from the extension to the use case it extends and the arrow uses a dashed line.</p>

                    <p>📦 The diagram below can be used to indicate that the system generates daily reports at midnight.</p><img src="/website/book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/systemAsActor.jpg" height="200"></tip-box>
                  <p>However, others argue that only use cases providing value to an external user/system should be shown in the use case diagram. For example, they argue that ‘view daily report’ should be the use case and <code>generate daily report</code>                    is not to be shown in the use case diagram because it is simply something the system has to do to support the <code>view daily report</code> use case.</p>
                  <p>We recommend that you follow the latter view (i.e. not to use System as a user). Limit use cases for Modeling Behaviors that involve an external actor.</p>
                  <p><strong>UML is not very specific about the text contents of a use case.</strong> Hence, there are many styles for writing use cases. For example, the steps can be written as a continuous paragraph. Use cases should be easy to read. Note
                    that there is no strict rule about writing all details of all steps or a need to use all the elements of a use case.</p>
                  <p><strong>There are some advantages of documenting system requirements as use cases:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Because they use a simple notation and plain English descriptions, they are easy for users to understand and give feedback.</li>
                    <li>They decouple user intention from mechanism (note that use cases should not include UI-specific details), allowing the system designers more freedom to optimize how a functionality is provided to a user.</li>
                    <li>Identifying all possible extensions encourages us to consider all situations that a software product might face during its operation.</li>
                    <li>Separating typical scenarios from special cases encourages us to optimize the typical scenarios.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>One of the main disadvantages of use cases is that they are not good for capturing requirements that does not involve a user interacting with the system.</strong> Hence, they should not be used as the sole means to specify requirements.</p>

      <p><strong>Objective</strong>: Move the product from v1.0 towards v2.0 in a small incremental step.</p>
      <p><strong>Description</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Each member should add some enhancements that are in line with the vision for v2.0.</li>
        <li>These enhancements should go beyond the component you are in charge of, touching as many other components as possible.

        <ul>
          <li>By the end of this project (i.e. by v1.5) each team member is expected to have implemented 1 or more enhancement/feature end-to-end, doing required changes in <em>almost all</em> components. The objective is to force you to learn all components
            of the software, instead of limiting yourself to just one/few components.</li>
          <li>However, you will continue to be <em>in charge</em> of components that were allocated to you at v1.0 (you can change the allocation later if you wish) while others will be modifying those components as necessary for the features they are implementing.
            Your role as the <em>in charge</em> of a component is to guide others modifying that component <span class="dimmed"> (reason: you are supposed to be the most knowledgeable about that component)</span> and protect that component from degrading
            <span class="dimmed"> e.g., you can review others' changes to your component and suggest possible changes</span>.</li>

      <div>
        <h2 id="project-schedule-tracking">Project Schedule Tracking</h2>
        <p>In general, use the issue tracker (Milestones, Issues, PRs, Tags, Releases, and Labels) for assigning, scheduling, and tracking <em>all</em> noteworthy project tasks, including user stories. Update the issue tracker regularly to reflect the current
          status of the project. You can also use GitHub's new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU">Projects feature</a> to manage the project, but keep it linked to the issue tracker as much as you can.</p>
        <h3 id="using-issues">Using Issues:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Record each of the user stories you plan to deliver as an issue in the issue tracker.</strong><span class="dimmed">e.g.</span><code>Title: As a user I can add a deadline</code><br><code>Description: ... so that I can keep track of my deadlines</code></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Assign the <code>type.*</code> and <code>priority.*</code> labels to those issues.</strong></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>When you start implementing a story, break it down to tasks.</strong> Define reasonable sized, standalone tasks. A task should be able to done by one person, in a few hours. <span class="dimmed">e.g.</span></p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="dimmed">👍 Good: Update class diagram in the project manual for v1.5</span></li>
              <li><span class="dimmed">👎 Bad (reasons: not a one-person task, not small enough): Write the project manual</span></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Write a descriptive title for the issue.</strong><span class="dimmed">e.g. Add support for the 'undo' command to the parser.</span></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>There is no need to break things into VERY small tasks.</strong> Keep them as big as possible, but they should be no bigger than what you are going to assign a single person to do within a week. <span class="dimmed">eg.,</span></p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>Implementing parser</code><span class="dimmed">: too big because it cannot be done by a single person in a week.</span></li>
              <li><code>Implementing parser support for adding of floating tasks</code><span class="dimmed">: appropriate size.</span></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Do not track things taken for granted.</strong><span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>push code to repo</code> should not be a task to track. In the example given under the previous point, it is taken for granted that the owner will also (a) test the code and (b) push to the repo when it is ready. Those two need not be tracked as separate tasks.</span></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Omit redundant details.</strong> In some cases, the summary/title is enough to describe the task. In that case, no need to repeat it in the description. There is no need for well-crafted and detailed descriptions for tasks. A minimal
              description is enough. Similarly, labels such as <code>priority</code> can be omitted if you think they don't help you.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Assign tasks to team members using the <code>assignees</code> field.</strong> At any point, there should be some ongoing tasks and some pending tasks against each team member.</p>
          </li>

            <p><strong>Optionally, you can use <code>status.ongoing</code> label to indicate issues currently ongoing.</strong></p>

      <p>💡 <strong>If tests are causing too much pain ...</strong></p>
      <p>Automated tests have benefits, but they can be a pain to write/maintain; GUI tests are especially hard to maintain because their behavior can sometimes depend on things such as the OS, resolution etc.</p>
      <p>If you find tests too big a burden, it is OK to get rid of some of the troublesome tests and rely more on manual testing instead. The less automated test coverage you have, the higher the risk of regressions; but it may be an acceptable trade-off
        under the circumstances if tests are slowing you down too much.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less. The less coverage you have, the higher the
              risk of regression bugs, which will cost marks if not fixed before the final submission.</li>
            <li>You <mark>must write <em>some</em> tests</mark> so that we can evaluate your ability to write tests.</li>
            <li>How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide. You learned different types of testing and what they try to achieve. Based on that, you should decide how much of each type is required. Similarly, you can decide to
              what extent you want to automate tests, depending on the benefits and the effort required.</li>
            <li>Applying TDD is optional. If you plan to test something, it is better to apply TDD because TDD ensures that you write functional code in a testable way. If you do it the normal way, you often find that it is hard to test the functional code
              because the code has low testability.</li>

      <p><strong>If the project is too difficult for you to keep up with, there is an easier path</strong></p>
      <p>💡 As CS2103/T is a core module for Computing students, the project standards are set high enough to train students for a CS/SE career. However, some of you may not have gained enough pre-requisite skills (possibly because you don't plan for a CS/SE-related
        career, or for some other reason) in previous modules to be able to survive a code base such as AddressBook-Level4 (AB4). Based on your v1.0-1.2 experience, you should now be able to decide weather you are in that category.</p>
      <p>If you think you are in that category (e.g. you haven't managed to merge any code to AB4 code base yet in spite of much trying) and you fear that you are not going to learn much by continuing to struggle in the AB4 code base, we are willing to let
        you go back to AB3 or AB2 code base and use that for your project instead. This decision can be made as a team or individually. We'll use the same criteria for grading your project either way, but naturally, work done in AB2/AB3 is going to earn
        significantly less marks than similar work done in AB4. If you want to take that option, please email us know before v1.3 deadline.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Attendance is strongly encouraged</strong> but not compulsory. Your participation in the session benefits your team because the number of testers testing your product will depend on how many members of your team is taking part in testing
        <span class="dimmed"> e.g. if 3 members of your team are taking part in testing, three other testers will be assigned to test your product</span>.</li>
      <li>There is <strong>no penalty for bugs reported</strong> at this session.</li>
      <li>The <strong>reward for reporting bugs</strong> or suggesting features: do <mark>include it in your <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v1.4-ppp">project portfolio page</trigger></mark> to show how you contributed to another project.</li>

    <p>We strongly recommend you to <strong>freeze features</strong> after reaching this milestone. As this is a release candidate, it should have all the features you intend to release at v1.5. Adding more features after this point is risky. The remaining

          <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less. The less coverage you have, the higher the
            risk of regression bugs, which will cost marks if not fixed before the final submission.</li>
          <li>You <mark>must write <em>some</em> tests</mark> so that we can evaluate your ability to write tests.</li>
          <li>How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide. You learned different types of testing and what they try to achieve. Based on that, you should decide how much of each type is required. Similarly, you can decide to what
            extent you want to automate tests, depending on the benefits and the effort required.</li>
          <li>Applying TDD is optional. If you plan to test something, it is better to apply TDD because TDD ensures that you write functional code in a testable way. If you do it the normal way, you often find that it is hard to test the functional code
            because the code has low testability.</li>

                      <p><strong>Among various dimensions of code quality, such as run-time efficiency, security, and robustness, one of the most important is understandability.</strong> This is because in any non-trivial software project, code needs to
                        be read, understood, and modified by other developers later on. Even if we do not intend to pass the code to someone else, code quality is still important because we all become 'strangers' to our own code someday.</p>

                            <p>Make the code as explicit as possible, even if the language syntax allows them to be implicit. Here are some examples:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Use explicit type conversion instead of implicit type conversion.</li>
                              <li>Use parentheses/braces to show grouping even when they can be skipped.</li>
                              <li>Use enumerations when a certain variable can take only a small number of finite values. For example, instead of declaring the variable 'state' as an integer and using values 0,1,2 to denote the states 'starting', 'enabled',
                                and 'disabled' respectively, declare 'state' as type <code>SystemState</code> and define an enumeration <code>SystemState</code> that has values <code>'STARTING'</code>, <code>'ENABLED'</code>, and <code>'DISABLED'</code>.</li>
                              <li>When statements should follow a particular order, try to make it obvious (with appropriate naming, or at least comments). For example, if you name two functions <code>'taskA()'</code> and <code>'taskB()'</code>, it is not
                                obvious which one should be called first. Contrast this with naming the functions <code>'phaseOne()'</code> and <code>'phaseTwo()'</code> instead. This is especially important when statements in one function must be called
                                before the other one.</li>

                              intermediary steps. Nevertheless, this order may affect the clarity of the story you are trying to tell. Choose the order that makes the story most readable.</p>

                                Ideally, you should use a profiler tool to identify the actual bottlenecks of the code first, and optimize only those parts.</li>

                              <li><strong>Hand-optimized code can be harder for the compiler to optimize</strong> (the simpler the code, the easier for the compiler to optimize it). In many cases a compiler can do a better job of optimizing the runtime code
                                if you don't get in the way by trying to hand-optimize the source code.</li>

                                        <p><strong>Abstraction</strong>: Abstraction is a technique for dealing with complexity. It works by establishing a level of complexity on which a person interacts with the system, suppressing the more complex details
                                          below the current level.</p>

                                    <p>Most programs are written to solve complex problems involving large amounts of intricate details. It is impossible to deal with all these details at the same time. The guiding principle of abstraction stipulates that
                                      we capture only details that are relevant to the current perspective or the task at hand.</p>

                                    as possible. This is why we recommend single level of abstraction per method and top-down coding.</p>

                            <p>The happy path (i.e. the execution path taken when everything goes well) should be clear and prominent in your code. Restructure the code to make the happy path unindented as much as possible. It is the ‘unusual’ cases that
                              should be indented. Someone reading the code should not get distracted by alternative paths taken when error conditions happen. One technique that could help in this regard is the use of <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?GuardClause">guard clauses</a>.</p>

                              <p>Example: Consider these variables</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li><code>colorBlack</code> : hex value for color black</li>
                                <li><code>colorWhite</code> : hex value for color white</li>
                                <li><code>colorBlue</code> : number of times blue is used</li>
                                <li><code>hexForRed</code> : : hex value for color red</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>This is misleading because <code>colorBlue</code> is named similar to <code>colorWhite</code> and <code>colorBlack</code> but has a different purpose while <code>hexForRed</code> is named differently but has very similar
                                purpose to the first two variables. The following is better:</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li><code>hexForBlack</code><code>hexForWhite</code><code>hexForRed</code></li>
                                <li><code>blueColorCount</code></li>

                            </tip-box>
                            <p>Avoid misleading or ambiguous names (e.g. those with multiple meanings), similar sounding names, hard-to-pronounce ones (e.g. avoid ambiguities like &quot;is that a lowercase L, capital I or number 1?&quot;, or &quot;is that
                              number 0 or letter O?&quot;), almost similar names.</p>

                            <p>Furthermore, use it for the intended default action and not just to execute the last option. If there is no default action, you can use the 'default' branch to detect errors (i.e. if execution reached the <code>default</code>                              branch, throw an exception). This also applies to the final <code>else</code> of an <code>if-else</code> construct. That is, the final <code>else</code> should mean 'everything else', and not the final option. Do not use
                              <code>else</code> when an <code>if</code> condition can be explicitly specified, unless there is absolutely no other possibility.</p>

                            <p><strong>Minimize global variables</strong>. Global variables may be the most convenient way to pass information around, but they do create implicit links between code segments that use the global variable. Avoid them as much

                            <p><strong>Define variables in the least possible scope</strong>. For example, if the variable is used only within the <code>if</code> block of the conditional statement, it should be declared inside that <code>if</code> block.</p>

      <li><strong>Target audience</strong>: Assume you are giving a demo to a higher-level manager of your company, to brief him/her on the current capabilities of the product.</li>
      <li><strong>Scope</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>Organize the demo to present a cohesive picture of the product as a whole, similar to the v1.5rc demo.</li>
          <li>Remember to explain the profile of the target user early in the demo.</li>
          <li>The scenarios you demonstrate should be chosen judiciously so that you cover the full range of your product's functionality. Give more time to stronger features (i.e. cover mundane/basic features fast). It is recommended you showcase how the
            product improves the user’s life rather than simply describe each feature.</li>
          <li>No need to cover design/implementation details as the manager is not interested in those details.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Dress code</strong> : The level of formality is up to you, but it is recommended that the whole team dress at the same level.</li>
      <li><strong>Structure:</strong><br> Demo the product using the same executable you submitted, on your own laptop, using the TV.<br> Every team member should take part in the demo. However, it's ok for one member to do all the typing.</li>
      <li><strong>Optimizing the time:</strong><br> Try to make the maximum use of the short demo time in the following ways,
        <ul>
          <li>Spend as much time as possible on demonstrating the actual product. Not recommended to use slides (if you do, use them sparingly) or videos or lengthy narrations.<br> Avoid skits, re-enactments, dramatizations etc. This is not a sales pitch
            or an informercial. While you need to show how a user use the product to get value, but you don’t need to act like an imaginary user. For example, [Instead of this]<code>Jim get’s a call from boss. &quot;Ring ring&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;oh hi Jim, can we postpone the meeting?&quot; &quot;Sure&quot;. Jim hang up and curses the boss under his breath. Now he starts typing ..etc.</code><br>            [do this] <code>If Jim needs to postpone the meeting, he can type …</code><br> It’s not that dramatization is bad or we don’t like it. We simply don’t have enough time for it.<br> Note that CS2101 demo requirements may differ. Different context
            → Different requirements.</li>
          <li>Rehearse the steps well and ensure you can do a smooth demo. <mark>Demos that are clearly under-prepared will be penalized.</mark></li>
          <li>Don’t waste time repeating things the target audience already knows. e.g. no need to say things like &quot;We are students from NUS, SoC&quot;.</li>
          <li>No need to spend time describing features that existed in original AB4 but you can mention if you did any changes to those features.</li>
          <li>Bring sufficient amount of sample data and know how to load them to the system. You should not plan to type all the sample data during the demo itself. On the other hand, trying to demo a product using just 1-2 sample data creates a bad impression
            too.</li>
          <li>Plan the demo to be in sync with the impression you want to create. For example, if you are trying to convince that the product is easy to use, show the easiest way to perform a task before you show the full command with all the bells and whistles.</li>
          <li>Limit the demo to CLI inputs only. There is no point explaining GUI inputs because they don't earn marks.</li>

        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less. The less coverage you have, the higher the
              risk of regression bugs, which will cost marks if not fixed before the final submission.</li>
            <li>You <mark>must write <em>some</em> tests</mark> so that we can evaluate your ability to write tests.</li>
            <li>How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide. You learned different types of testing and what they try to achieve. Based on that, you should decide how much of each type is required. Similarly, you can decide to
              what extent you want to automate tests, depending on the benefits and the effort required.</li>
            <li>Applying TDD is optional. If you plan to test something, it is better to apply TDD because TDD ensures that you write functional code in a testable way. If you do it the normal way, you often find that it is hard to test the functional code
              because the code has low testability.</li>

Keep the tone of your feedback reasonably professional. Do not use offensive language or slang.</li><li>The feedback should be honest and consistent. Giving positive qualitative feedback (e.g. <code>Thanks for all the hard work!</code> and negative ratings (e.g. <code>Equal share - 40%</code>) to the same team member is not being honest.</li><li>State your expectations early. All too often students give positive/neutral feedback early (hoping that the team member will improve later) and trash the team member in the final evaluation (because the he/she did not improve as expected). However, this could be confusing to the recipient. It is better to give negative feedback early so that the team member gets a clear signal that he/she needs to improve.</li></ul></span>
    <p>The final peer evaluation (in week 13) is graded. In that peer-evaluation you will be asked to evaluate the work of your team members. The quality and accuracy of your evaluation will affect your grade and your evaluations will be considered as a
      data point in determining the grade of the team members.</p><img src="/website/admin/images/peer evaluations.png" width="600px"></div>

    <p><strong>Collaboration platform</strong>: You are <mark><em>required to</em> use GitHub</mark> as the hosting and collaboration platform of your project (i.e., to hold the Code repository, Issue Tracker, etc.). See <a href="/website/admin/index.html#admin-appendixE-github">Appendix E</a>      for more info on how to setup and use GitHub for your project.</p>
    <div id="communication">
      <p><strong>Communication</strong>: Keeping a record of communications among your team can help you, and us, in many ways. We encourage you to do at least some of the project communication in written medium (e.g., GitHub Issue Tracker) to practice how
        to communicate technical things in written form.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Instead of the IVLE forum, we encourage you to <mark>post your questions/suggestions in this <a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S1/forum/issues">github/nus-cs2103-AY1718/forum</a></mark>.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, you can post in our slack channel <a href="https://nus-cs2103.slack.com">https://nus-cs2103.slack.com</a>. We encourage you all to <mark>join the slack channel</mark> (you'll need to use an email address ending in <code>@nus.edu.sg</code>,
          <code>@comp.nus.edu.sg</code>, <code>@u.nus.edu.sg</code> or <code>@u.nus.edu</code> to join this channel).</li>
        <li>Note that slack is useful for quick chats while issue tracker is useful for longer-running conversations.</li>
        <li>You are encouraged to use channels with a wider audience (common channel in slack, GitHub issue tracker) for module-related communication as much as possible, rather than private channels such as private slack/FB messages or direct emails.

    <p><strong>IDE</strong>: You are recommended to use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">Intellij IDEA</a> for module-related programming work. You may use the community edition (free) or the ultimate edition (free for students). While the use of
      Intellij is not compulsory, note that module materials are optimized for Intellij. Use other IDEs at your own risk.</p>
    <p><strong>Revision control</strong>: You are <mark><em>required to</em> use Git</mark>. Other revision control software are not allowed.<br> The recommended GUI client for Git is <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a> (which comes bundled

        <p>There is no midterm.</p>
        <p>The final exam has two parts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Part 1: MCQ questions (1 hour, 24 marks)</li>
          <li>Part 2: Essay questions (1 hour, 16 marks)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Both papers will be given to you at the start but you need to <strong>answer Part 1 first</strong> (i.e. MCQ paper). It will be <strong>collected 1 hour after the exam start time</strong> (even if arrived late for the exam). You are free to start
          part 2 early if you finish Part 1 early.</p>
        <h2 id="final-exam-part-1-mcq">Final Exam: Part 1 (MCQ)</h2>
        <p>Each MCQ question gives you a statement to evaluate.</p>
        <tip-box>
          <p>📦 An example statement</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Testing is a Q&amp;A activity</p>
          </blockquote>
        </tip-box>
        <p>Unless stated otherwise, the meaning of answer options are<br><strong>A.</strong><code>Agree with confidence</code><br><strong>B.</strong><code>Agree, but not confident</code><br><strong>C.</strong><code>Question unclear</code> (in this case,
          write down your doubt in the question paper)<br><strong>D.</strong><code>Disagree, but not confident</code><br><strong>E.</strong><code>Disagree with confidence</code></p>
        <p><strong>Incorrect answers receive negative marks.</strong> Here is an example marking scheme for a question that gives you a correct statement. <span class="dimmed"> The scheme will be reversed if the statement given is incorrect.</span></p>
        <p>A. Agree with confidence <strong>(+0.2)</strong><br> B. Agree, but not confident <strong>(+0.1)</strong><br> C. Question unclear <strong>(0)</strong><br> D. Disagree, but not confident <strong>(-0.1)</strong><br> E. Disagree with confidence <strong>(-0.2)</strong><br></p>
        <p><span class="dimmed"> Negative marks are necessary because all questions are Agree/Disagree type. Without negative marks, anyone can score roughly half the marks by simply choosing the same option for all questions.</span></p>
        <p><strong>All questions carry equal marks.</strong></p>
        <p>The exam paper has 133 questions.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>3 are dummy questions used for admin purposes (not graded).</li>
          <li>The remaining 130 questions includes <strong>10 extra questions</strong>. i.e., you need only 120 correct answers to get full marks.
            <ul>
              <li>These extra questions are meant as a safety buffer against mistakes you might commit under exam pressure or questions that are not clear to you.</li>
              <li>Alternatively, you can simply skip (or use option C for) 10 questions.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that you have <strong>slightly less than ½ minute for each question</strong>, which means you need to go through the questions fairly quickly.</p>
        <p>Given the fast pace required by the paper, to be fair to all students, <strong>you will not be allowed to clarify doubts about questions</strong> (in Part 1) by talking to invigilators.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If a question is not clear, you can choose option C and write your doubt in the exam paper, near the unclear question.</li>
          <li>If your doubt is justified (e.g. there is a typo in the question) or if many students found the question to be unclear, the examiner may decide to omit that question from grading.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Questions in Part 1 are confidential.</strong> You are not allowed to reveal Part 1 content to anyone after the exam. All pages of the assessment paper are to be returned at the end of the exam.</p>
        <p>You will be given OCR forms to indicate your answers for Part 1. As each OCR form can accommodate only 50 answers, you will be given three OCR forms. <strong>Indicate your student number in all three OCR forms</strong>.</p>
        <p>To save space, we use the following notation in MCQ question.
          <strong>[<span class="underline">x</span> | y | <span class="underline">z</span>] means ‘x and z, but not y’</strong></p>
        <tip-box>
          <p>📦 SE is [boring | <span class="underline">useful</span> | <span class="underline">fun</span>] means <em>SE is not boring</em> AND <em>SE is useful</em> AND <em>SE is fun</em>.</p>
          <p>📦 Consider the following statement:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>IDEs can help with [<span class="underline">writing</span> | debugging | <span class="underline">testing</span>] code.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The correct response for it is <code>Disagree with confidence</code> because IDEs can help with all three of the given options, not just writing and testing.</p>
        </tip-box>
        <p>Some questions will use <span class="underline">underlines</span> or <mark>highlighting</mark> to draw your attention to a specific part of the question. That is because those parts are highly relevant to the answer and we don’t want you to miss
          the relevance of that part.</p>
        <tip-box>
          <p>📦 Consider the statement below:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Technique ABC <span class="underline">can</span> be used to generate more test cases.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The word <span class="underline">can</span> is underlined because the decision you need to make is whether the ABC <em>can or cannot</em> be used to generate more test cases; the decision is not whether ABC can be used to generate <em>more or better</em>            test cases.</p>
        </tip-box>
        <p>Markers such as the one given below appears at left margin of the paper to <strong>indicate where the question corresponds to a new column in the OCR form</strong>. E.g. questions 11, 21, 31, etc. (a column has 10 questions). Such markers can
          help you to detect if you missed a question in the previous 10 questions. You can safely ignore those markers if you are not interested in making use of that additional hint.</p>
        <p><img src="/website/admin/images/columnMarker.png"><br></p>
        <p>Some questions have tags e.g., the question below has a tag <strong><code>JAVA</code></strong>. These <strong>tags provide additional context about the question</strong>. In the example below, the tag indicates that the code given in the question
          is Java code.</p>
        <p><img src="/website/admin/images/contextTag.png"><br></p>
        <p><strong>The paper is open-book</strong>: you may bring any printed or written materials to the exam in hard copy format. However, given the fast pace required by Part 1, you will not have time left to refer notes during that part of the exam.</p>
        <p>💡 <strong>Mark the OCR form as you go</strong>, rather than planning to transfer your answers to the OCR form near the end. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: Given there are 130+ questions, it will be hard to estimate how much time you need to mass-transfer all answers to OCR forms.</span></p>
        <p>💡 <strong>Write the answer in the exam paper as well</strong> as marking it in the OCR form. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: It will reduce the chance of missing a question. Furthermore, in case you missed a question, it will help you correct the OCR form quickly.</span></p>
        <p>💡 We have tried to <strong>avoid deliberately misleading/tricky questions</strong>. If a question seems to take a very long time to figure out, you are probably over-thinking it.</p>
        <h2 id="final-exam-part-2-essay">Final Exam: Part 2 (Essay)</h2>
        <p>Unlike in part 1, <strong>you can ask invigilators for clarifications</strong> if you found a question to be unclear in part 2.</p>
        <p>Yes, <strong>you may use pencils</strong> when answering part 2.</p>

                <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less. The less coverage you have, the higher
                  the risk of regression bugs, which will cost marks if not fixed before the final submission.</li>
                <li>You <mark>must write <em>some</em> tests</mark> so that we can evaluate your ability to write tests.</li>
                <li>How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide. You learned different types of testing and what they try to achieve. Based on that, you should decide how much of each type is required. Similarly, you can decide
                  to what extent you want to automate tests, depending on the benefits and the effort required.</li>
                <li>Applying TDD is optional. If you plan to test something, it is better to apply TDD because TDD ensures that you write functional code in a testable way. If you do it the normal way, you often find that it is hard to test the functional
                  code because the code has low testability.</li>

    <p>There is no midterm.</p>
    <p>The final exam has two parts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Part 1: MCQ questions (1 hour, 24 marks)</li>
      <li>Part 2: Essay questions (1 hour, 16 marks)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both papers will be given to you at the start but you need to <strong>answer Part 1 first</strong> (i.e. MCQ paper). It will be <strong>collected 1 hour after the exam start time</strong> (even if arrived late for the exam). You are free to start
      part 2 early if you finish Part 1 early.</p>
    <h2 id="final-exam-part-1-mcq-2">Final Exam: Part 1 (MCQ)</h2>
    <p>Each MCQ question gives you a statement to evaluate.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 An example statement</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Testing is a Q&amp;A activity</p>
      </blockquote>
    </tip-box>
    <p>Unless stated otherwise, the meaning of answer options are<br><strong>A.</strong><code>Agree with confidence</code><br><strong>B.</strong><code>Agree, but not confident</code><br><strong>C.</strong><code>Question unclear</code> (in this case, write
      down your doubt in the question paper)<br><strong>D.</strong><code>Disagree, but not confident</code><br><strong>E.</strong><code>Disagree with confidence</code></p>
    <p><strong>Incorrect answers receive negative marks.</strong> Here is an example marking scheme for a question that gives you a correct statement. <span class="dimmed"> The scheme will be reversed if the statement given is incorrect.</span></p>
    <p>A. Agree with confidence <strong>(+0.2)</strong><br> B. Agree, but not confident <strong>(+0.1)</strong><br> C. Question unclear <strong>(0)</strong><br> D. Disagree, but not confident <strong>(-0.1)</strong><br> E. Disagree with confidence <strong>(-0.2)</strong><br></p>
    <p><span class="dimmed"> Negative marks are necessary because all questions are Agree/Disagree type. Without negative marks, anyone can score roughly half the marks by simply choosing the same option for all questions.</span></p>
    <p><strong>All questions carry equal marks.</strong></p>
    <p>The exam paper has 133 questions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>3 are dummy questions used for admin purposes (not graded).</li>
      <li>The remaining 130 questions includes <strong>10 extra questions</strong>. i.e., you need only 120 correct answers to get full marks.
        <ul>
          <li>These extra questions are meant as a safety buffer against mistakes you might commit under exam pressure or questions that are not clear to you.</li>
          <li>Alternatively, you can simply skip (or use option C for) 10 questions.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that you have <strong>slightly less than ½ minute for each question</strong>, which means you need to go through the questions fairly quickly.</p>
    <p>Given the fast pace required by the paper, to be fair to all students, <strong>you will not be allowed to clarify doubts about questions</strong> (in Part 1) by talking to invigilators.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If a question is not clear, you can choose option C and write your doubt in the exam paper, near the unclear question.</li>
      <li>If your doubt is justified (e.g. there is a typo in the question) or if many students found the question to be unclear, the examiner may decide to omit that question from grading.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Questions in Part 1 are confidential.</strong> You are not allowed to reveal Part 1 content to anyone after the exam. All pages of the assessment paper are to be returned at the end of the exam.</p>
    <p>You will be given OCR forms to indicate your answers for Part 1. As each OCR form can accommodate only 50 answers, you will be given three OCR forms. <strong>Indicate your student number in all three OCR forms</strong>.</p>
    <p>To save space, we use the following notation in MCQ question.
      <strong>[<span class="underline">x</span> | y | <span class="underline">z</span>] means ‘x and z, but not y’</strong></p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 SE is [boring | <span class="underline">useful</span> | <span class="underline">fun</span>] means <em>SE is not boring</em> AND <em>SE is useful</em> AND <em>SE is fun</em>.</p>
      <p>📦 Consider the following statement:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>IDEs can help with [<span class="underline">writing</span> | debugging | <span class="underline">testing</span>] code.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The correct response for it is <code>Disagree with confidence</code> because IDEs can help with all three of the given options, not just writing and testing.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p>Some questions will use <span class="underline">underlines</span> or <mark>highlighting</mark> to draw your attention to a specific part of the question. That is because those parts are highly relevant to the answer and we don’t want you to miss the
      relevance of that part.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Consider the statement below:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Technique ABC <span class="underline">can</span> be used to generate more test cases.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The word <span class="underline">can</span> is underlined because the decision you need to make is whether the ABC <em>can or cannot</em> be used to generate more test cases; the decision is not whether ABC can be used to generate <em>more or better</em>        test cases.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p>Markers such as the one given below appears at left margin of the paper to <strong>indicate where the question corresponds to a new column in the OCR form</strong>. E.g. questions 11, 21, 31, etc. (a column has 10 questions). Such markers can help
      you to detect if you missed a question in the previous 10 questions. You can safely ignore those markers if you are not interested in making use of that additional hint.</p>
    <p><img src="/website/admin/images/columnMarker.png"><br></p>
    <p>Some questions have tags e.g., the question below has a tag <strong><code>JAVA</code></strong>. These <strong>tags provide additional context about the question</strong>. In the example below, the tag indicates that the code given in the question
      is Java code.</p>
    <p><img src="/website/admin/images/contextTag.png"><br></p>
    <p><strong>The paper is open-book</strong>: you may bring any printed or written materials to the exam in hard copy format. However, given the fast pace required by Part 1, you will not have time left to refer notes during that part of the exam.</p>
    <p>💡 <strong>Mark the OCR form as you go</strong>, rather than planning to transfer your answers to the OCR form near the end. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: Given there are 130+ questions, it will be hard to estimate how much time you need to mass-transfer all answers to OCR forms.</span></p>
    <p>💡 <strong>Write the answer in the exam paper as well</strong> as marking it in the OCR form. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: It will reduce the chance of missing a question. Furthermore, in case you missed a question, it will help you correct the OCR form quickly.</span></p>
    <p>💡 We have tried to <strong>avoid deliberately misleading/tricky questions</strong>. If a question seems to take a very long time to figure out, you are probably over-thinking it.</p>
    <h2 id="final-exam-part-2-essay-2">Final Exam: Part 2 (Essay)</h2>
    <p>Unlike in part 1, <strong>you can ask invigilators for clarifications</strong> if you found a question to be unclear in part 2.</p>
    <p>Yes, <strong>you may use pencils</strong> when answering part 2.</p>

    <p>These are some of the main principles underlying the module structure.</p>
    <tip-box type="important">
      The product is you, NOT what you build.
    </tip-box>
    <p>The software product you build is a side effect only. You are the product of this module. This means,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We may not take the most efficient route to building the software product. <strong>We take the route that allows you to learn the most</strong>.</li>
      <li>Building a software product that is unique, creative, and shiny is not our priority (although we try to do a bit of that too). <strong>Learning to take pride in, and discovering the joy of, high quality software engineering work is our priority</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Following from that, we evaluate you on not just how much you've done, but also, how well you've done those things. Here are some of the aspects in which we focus on:</p>

    <p><strong>We learn together, NOT compete against each other.</strong></p>
    <p>You are not in a competition. Our grading is not forced on a bell curve.</p>
    <p>Learn from each other. That is why we open-source your submissions.</p>
    <p>Teach each other, even those in other teams. Those who do it well can become tutors next time.</p>
    <p><strong>Continuously engage, NOT last minute heroics.</strong></p>
    <p>We want to train you to do software engineering in a steady and repeatable manner that does not require 'last minute heroics'.</p>
    <p>In this module, last minute heroics will not earn you a good project grade, and last minute mugging will not earn you a good exam grade.</p>
    <p><strong>Where you reach at the end matters, NOT what you knew at the beginning.</strong></p>
    <p>When you start the module, some others in the class may appear to know a lot more than you. Don't let that worry you. The final grade depends on what you know at the end, not what you knew to begin with. All marks allocated to intermediate deliverables
      are within the reach of everyone in the class irrespective of their prior knowledge.</p>

      <p>When working with others, especially in a large class such as CS2103,  it is very important that you adhere to standards, policies, and instructions imposed on everyone. Not doing so creates unnecessary headaches for everyone and sends negative

        likely that the prof did not notice your post or the email got stuck somewhere.</p>
      <p>Similarly we expect you to check email regularly and respond to emails written to you personally (not mass email) promptly.</p>
      <panel header="Email etiquette: ALWAYS respond to direct emails" expanded="">
        <p>Not responding to a personal email is a major breach of professional etiquette (and general civility). Imagine how pissed off you would be if you met the prof along the corridor, said 'Hi prof, good morning' and the prof walked away without saying
          anything back. Not responding to a personal email is just as bad. Always take a few seconds to at least acknowledge such emails.  It doesn't take long to type &quot;Noted. Thanks&quot; and hit 'send'.</p>
        <p>The promptness of a reply is even more important when the email is requesting you for something that you cannot provide. Imagine you wrote to the prof requesting a reference letter and the prof did not respond at all because he/she did not want
          to give you one; You'll be quite frustrated because you wouldn't know whether to look for another prof or wait longer for a response. Saying 'No' is fine and in fact a necessary part of professional life; but saying nothing is not acceptable.
          If you didn't reply, the sender will not even know whether you received the email.</p>

          <p>Note: This guide is mostly about getting tech help, but it also applies to getting clarifications on module topics too. e.g. what is the difference between <em>refactoring</em> and <em>rewriting</em>?</p>
          <p>What not to do:</p>
          <p>When faced with a technical problem or a doubt about a concept, don'f fire off an email lecturer/tutor immediately after you encounter a problem or a doubt, unless it is something only the lecturer/tutor is supposed to know. Instead, here are
            some things you can do:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Check what is given</strong>: Check if the problem/concept has been discussed in the lectures, text book, or the list of resources given to you. Yes it is easier for you to write an email to the tutor/lecturer instead, but that shouldn't
                be your default behavior. We know that sometimes it is difficult to find stuff in the resources we have provided. But you should try first.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Search</strong>: It is very likely the answer already exists somewhere in the cyberspace. Almost every programming-related question has been answered in places like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>. Don't give
                an opportunity for someone to ask you to <a href="http://www.jibble.org/stfw/">STFW</a>.<br> Pay attention to the error message you encounter. Sometimes it also contains hints as to how to fix the problem. Even if not, a web search on
                the error message is a good starting point.  <br><img src="/website/admin/images/how to google it.png" width="460" height="268"></p>

            <li>
              <p><strong>Ask peers</strong>:</p>
              <p>Ask your team members.</p>
              <p>Ask classmates using the module forum or the slack channel. Even if you figured out one way to solve a problem, discussing it on a public forum might lead you to better ways of solving it, and will help other classmates who are facing similar
                problems too. If you are really shy to ask questions in the forum, you may use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vf2TjVhASq_u1_kQEEyURE5fTeBg6iKwGQDJUxYiAmg/viewform">this form</a> to submit your question anonymously which we will

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>PLEASE search for existing answers before you post your question in those public forums; You don't want to appear as a 'clueless' or 'too lazy to do your research' person in a public forum.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Learn to isolate the problem. &quot;My code doesn't work&quot; isn't going to help even if you post the whole code online. Others don't have time to go through all of your code. Isolate the part that doesn't work and strip it down to
                    the bare minimum that is enough reproduce the error. Sometimes, this process actually helps you to figure out the problem yourself. If not, at least it increases the chance of someone else being able to help you.<br>
                    <tip-box type="tip">
                      How to isolate problematic code? Delete code (one bit at a time) that is confirmed as not related to the problem. Do that until you can still reproduce the problem with the least amount of code remaining.
                    </tip-box>
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Generalize the problem. &quot;How to write tasks to a text file using Java&quot; is too specific to what you are working on. You are more likely to find help if you post a thread called (or search for) &quot;How to write to a file using
                    Java&quot;.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Explain well. Conversations via online forums take time. If you post everything that is relevant to your problem, your chances of getting an answer in the first try is higher. If others have to ask you more questions before they can
                    help you, it will take longer. But this doesn't mean you dump too much information into the thread either.<br>

      <p>The source code are publicly available and are available for reuse by others without any restrictions. <br> Is publishing submissions unfair to the team? We don't think so. If you were the first to think of something your peers are willing to adopt

      <p>Detection:</p>

      <p>Penalties:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For submissions not affecting marks: We make a record of cases of plagiarism but we do not take further action. Such plagiarism does not disadvantage other students. Therefore, we prefer to spend all available resources on helping honest students

      <p><strong>Reuse is encouraged. However, note that reuse has its own costs</strong> (such as the learning curve, additional complexity, usage restrictions, and unknown bugs). Furthermore, you will not be given credit for work done by others. Rather,
        you will be given credit for using work done by others.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You are allowed to reuse work from your classmates, subject to following conditions:
          <ul>
            <li>The work has been published by us or the authors.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>The work comes from a source of 'good standing' (such as an established open source project). This means you cannot reuse code written by an outside 'friend'.</li>
            <li>You clearly give credit to the original author. Acknowledge use of third party resources clearly e.g. in the welcome message, splash screen (if any) or under the 'about' menu. If you are open about reuse, you are less likely to get into trouble
              if you unintentionally reused something copyrighted.</li>
            <li>You do not violate the license under which the work has been released. Please  <strong>do not use 3rd-party images/audio</strong> in your software unless they have been specifically released to be used freely. Just because you found it in

      <p>CS2103/T prepares you for many higher-level project modules (CS3216/7, CS3201/2, CS3281/2, CG3002, etc.), each requiring a slightly different skill set. It is also the only SE course some of you do before going for industry internships. Therefore,
        we have to cover many essential SE concepts/skills and also provide enough exercises for you to practice those skills. This is also why we don't have time to go very deep into any of the topics.</p>
      <p>Remember, everything you learn here is going to be useful in a SE-related career.</p>

      <p>Sometimes, small things matter in big ways. e.g., all other things being equal, a job may be offered to the candidate who has the neater looking CV although both have the same qualifications. This may be unfair, but that's how the world works. Students
        forget this harsh reality when they are in the protected environment of the school and tend to get sloppy with their work habits. That is why we reward all positive behavior, even small ones (e.g., following precise submission instructions, arriving
        on time etc.).</p>
      <p>But unlike the real world, we are forgiving. That is why you can still earn full 10 marks of the participation marks even if you miss a few things here and there.</p>

      <p>We have a separate website because some of the module information does not fit into the structure imposed by IVLE.</p>
      <p>On a related note, keep in mind that 'hunting and gathering' of relevant information is one of the skills you need to survive 'in the wild'. Do not always expect all relevant materials to appear 'magically' in some kind of 'work bin'.</p>

      <p>Self-study is a critical survival skill in SE industry. Lectures will show you the way, but absorbing content is to be done at your own pace, by yourself. In this module, we still tell you what content to study and also pass most of the content
        to you. After you graduate, you have to decide what to study and find your own content too.</p>

    <h3 id="why-very-narrow-project-scope">Why very narrow project scope?</h3>
    <div id="admin-faq-narrowScope">
      <p>Defining your own unique project is more fun.</p>
      <p>But, wider scope → more diverse projects → harder for us to go deep into your project. The collective know-how we (i.e., students and the teaching team) have built up about SE issues related to the project become shallow and stretched too thinly.
        It also affects fairness of grading.</p><img src="/website/admin/images/limited project scope.png" width="772" height="296">
      <p>That is why a strictly-defined project is more suitable for a first course in SE that focuses on nuts-and-bolts of SE. After learning those fundamentals, in higher level project modules you can focus more on the creative side of software projects
        without being dragged down by nuts-and-bolts SE issues (because you already know how to deal with them). However, we would like to allow some room for creativity too. That is why we let you build products that are slight variations of a given
        theme.</p>
      <p>Also note: <strong>The freedom to do 'anything' is not a necessary condition for creativity</strong>. Do not mistake being different for being creative. In fact, the more constrained you are, the more you need creativity to stand out.</p>

    <h3 id="why-project-requirements-are-so-vague">Why project requirements are so vague?</h3>
    <div id="admin-faq-vagueRequirements"><img src="/website/admin/images/vague requirement.png" width="737" height="210">
      <p>&quot;You tell me exactly what to do - I do that - you pay me (in grades)&quot; is a model for contract work, not for learning. Being able to survive in imprecise, uncertain, volatile problem contexts is precisely what we are trying to teach you.</p>
      <p>For example, the best way to communicate something often depends on what is being communicated. That is why we don't specify the precise content for project documents. Instead, we aim to refine project documents iteratively. We believe the learning
        experience will be richer if we let you decide the best way to present your project information rather than just following our instructions blindly. For example, in real-life projects you are rarely told which diagrams to draw; that is a decision
        you have to make yourself.</p>

    <h3 id="why-im-not-allowed-to-use-my-favorite-toolframeworklanguage-etc">Why I'm not allowed to use my favorite tool/framework/language etc.?</h3>
    <div id="admin-faq-favoriteTool"><img src="/website/admin/images/I'm not allowed to use my favorite tool.png" width="750" height="287">
      <p>We have chosen a basic set of tools after considering ease of learning, availability, typical-ness, popularity, migration path to other tools, etc. There are many reasons for limiting your choices:</p>
      <p>Pedagogical reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sometimes 'good enough', not necessarily the best, tools are a better fit for beginners</strong>: Most bleeding edge, most specialized, or most sophisticated tools are not suitable for a beginner course. After mastering our toolset, you
          will find it easy to upgrade to such high-end tools by yourself. We do expect you to eventually (after this module) migrate to better tools and, having learned more than one tool, to attain a more general understanding about a family of tools.</li>
        <li><strong>We want you to learn to thrive under given conditions</strong>: As a professional Software Engineer, you must learn to be productive in any given tool environment, rather than insist on using your preferred tools. It is usually in small
          companies doing less important work that you get to chose your own toolset. Bigger companies working on mature products often impose some choices on developers, such as the project management tool, code repository, IDE, language etc. For example,
          Google used SVN as their revision control software until very recently, long after SVN fell out of popularity among developers. Sometimes this is due to cost reasons (tool licensing cost), and sometimes due to legacy reasons (because the tool
          is already entrenched in their code base).<br> While programming in school is often a solo sport, programming in the industry is a team sport. As we are training you to become professional software engineers, it is important to get over the
          psychological hurdle of needing to satisfy individual preferences and get used to making the best of a given environment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Practical reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some of the LOs are tightly coupled to tools. Allowing more tools means tutors need to learn more tools, which increases their workload.</li>
        <li>We provide learning resources for tools. e.g. 'Git guides'. Allowing more tools means we need to produce more resources.</li>
        <li>When all students use the same tool, the collective expertise of the tool is more, increasing the opportunities for you to learn from each others.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Meanwhile, feel free to share with peers your experience of using other tools.</p>

    <h3 id="why-so-many-submissions">Why so many submissions?</h3>
    <div id="admin-faq-manySubmissions"><img src="/website/admin/images/frequent submissions.png" width="759" height="359">
      <p>The high number of submissions is not meant to increase workload but to spread it across the semester. Learning theory and applying them should be done in parallel to maximize the learning effect. That can happen only if we spread theory and 'application
        of theory' (i.e., project work) evenly across the semester.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="why-arent-we-allowed-to-build-a-new-product-from-scratch">Why aren't we allowed to build a new product from scratch?</h3>
    <div id="admin-faq-fromScratch">
      <p>There are many reasons. One of them is that most of you will be working with existing software in your first few years of the career while hardly any school projects train you to work with existing code bases. We decided to bite the bullet and use
        CS2103/T to train you to work in existing code bases.</p>

      <p>They do, and they should.</p>
      <p>CS2103T communication requirements are limited to a very narrow scope (i.e., communicate about the product to users and developers). CS2101 aims to teach you technical communication in a much wider context. While you may be able to reuse some of
        the stuff across the two modules, submissions are not intended to be exactly the same.</p>

    <p><strong>We want to move you away from 'hand holding' and make you learn how to solve problems on your own.</strong> This is a vital survival skill in the industry and it needs practice.</p>
    <p>Whether it is a technical problem <span class="dimmed">(e.g. error when using the IDE)</span> or a doubt about a concept <span class="dimmed">(e.g. what is the difference between scripted testing and exploratory testing?)</span><strong>we the teaching team are happy to work <em>with</em> you when you look for a solution/answer, but we do not do it <em>for</em> you.</strong>      We discourage unconditional direct help from tutors because we want you to learn to help yourself. Yes, we believe in ‘tough love’😝.</p>
    <p>The question you should always ask yourself is, 'how do I solve this problem if the lecturer/tutors are not around to help me?'</p><img src="/website/admin/images/the good reasons to get home early.png" width="300">
    <p>Note: This guide is mostly about getting tech help, but it also applies to getting clarifications on module topics too. e.g. what is the difference between <em>refactoring</em> and <em>rewriting</em>?</p>
    <p>What not to do:</p>
    <p>When faced with a technical problem or a doubt about a concept, don'f fire off an email lecturer/tutor immediately after you encounter a problem or a doubt, unless it is something only the lecturer/tutor is supposed to know. Instead, here are some
      things you can do:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Check what is given</strong>: Check if the problem/concept has been discussed in the lectures, text book, or the list of resources given to you. Yes it is easier for you to write an email to the tutor/lecturer instead, but that shouldn't
          be your default behavior. We know that sometimes it is difficult to find stuff in the resources we have provided. But you should try first.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Search</strong>: It is very likely the answer already exists somewhere in the cyberspace. Almost every programming-related question has been answered in places like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>. Don't give an opportunity
          for someone to ask you to <a href="http://www.jibble.org/stfw/">STFW</a>.<br> Pay attention to the error message you encounter. Sometimes it also contains hints as to how to fix the problem. Even if not, a web search on the error message is
          a good starting point.  <br><img src="/website/admin/images/how to google it.png" width="460" height="268"></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Ask peers</strong>:</p>
        <p>Ask your team members.</p>
        <p>Ask classmates using the module forum or the slack channel. Even if you figured out one way to solve a problem, discussing it on a public forum might lead you to better ways of solving it, and will help other classmates who are facing similar
          problems too. If you are really shy to ask questions in the forum, you may use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vf2TjVhASq_u1_kQEEyURE5fTeBg6iKwGQDJUxYiAmg/viewform">this form</a> to submit your question anonymously which we will then

          <p><em>Rubber duck debugging</em> is an informal term used in software engineering to refer to a method of debugging code. The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber
            duck and debug his code by forcing himself to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck.</p>

        <p><strong>Ask the world</strong> using programming forums such as stackoverflow.</p>
        <p>Here are some tips for posting help request:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>PLEASE search for existing answers before you post your question in those public forums; You don't want to appear as a 'clueless' or 'too lazy to do your research' person in a public forum.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Learn to isolate the problem. &quot;My code doesn't work&quot; isn't going to help even if you post the whole code online. Others don't have time to go through all of your code. Isolate the part that doesn't work and strip it down to the bare
              minimum that is enough reproduce the error. Sometimes, this process actually helps you to figure out the problem yourself. If not, at least it increases the chance of someone else being able to help you.<br>
              <tip-box type="tip">
                How to isolate problematic code? Delete code (one bit at a time) that is confirmed as not related to the problem. Do that until you can still reproduce the problem with the least amount of code remaining.
              </tip-box>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Generalize the problem. &quot;How to write tasks to a text file using Java&quot; is too specific to what you are working on. You are more likely to find help if you post a thread called (or search for) &quot;How to write to a file using Java&quot;.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Explain well. Conversations via online forums take time. If you post everything that is relevant to your problem, your chances of getting an answer in the first try is higher. If others have to ask you more questions before they can help you,
              it will take longer. But this doesn't mean you dump too much information into the thread either.<br>

      <h2 id="project-schedule-tracking-2">Project Schedule Tracking</h2>
      <p>In general, use the issue tracker (Milestones, Issues, PRs, Tags, Releases, and Labels) for assigning, scheduling, and tracking <em>all</em> noteworthy project tasks, including user stories. Update the issue tracker regularly to reflect the current
        status of the project. You can also use GitHub's new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU">Projects feature</a> to manage the project, but keep it linked to the issue tracker as much as you can.</p>
      <h3 id="using-issues-2">Using Issues:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Record each of the user stories you plan to deliver as an issue in the issue tracker.</strong><span class="dimmed">e.g.</span><code>Title: As a user I can add a deadline</code><br><code>Description: ... so that I can keep track of my deadlines</code></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Assign the <code>type.*</code> and <code>priority.*</code> labels to those issues.</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>When you start implementing a story, break it down to tasks.</strong> Define reasonable sized, standalone tasks. A task should be able to done by one person, in a few hours. <span class="dimmed">e.g.</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="dimmed">👍 Good: Update class diagram in the project manual for v1.5</span></li>
            <li><span class="dimmed">👎 Bad (reasons: not a one-person task, not small enough): Write the project manual</span></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Write a descriptive title for the issue.</strong><span class="dimmed">e.g. Add support for the 'undo' command to the parser.</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>There is no need to break things into VERY small tasks.</strong> Keep them as big as possible, but they should be no bigger than what you are going to assign a single person to do within a week. <span class="dimmed">eg.,</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>Implementing parser</code><span class="dimmed">: too big because it cannot be done by a single person in a week.</span></li>
            <li><code>Implementing parser support for adding of floating tasks</code><span class="dimmed">: appropriate size.</span></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Do not track things taken for granted.</strong><span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>push code to repo</code> should not be a task to track. In the example given under the previous point, it is taken for granted that the owner will also (a) test the code and (b) push to the repo when it is ready. Those two need not be tracked as separate tasks.</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Omit redundant details.</strong> In some cases, the summary/title is enough to describe the task. In that case, no need to repeat it in the description. There is no need for well-crafted and detailed descriptions for tasks. A minimal
            description is enough. Similarly, labels such as <code>priority</code> can be omitted if you think they don't help you.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Assign tasks to team members using the <code>assignees</code> field.</strong> At any point, there should be some ongoing tasks and some pending tasks against each team member.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Optionally, you can use <code>status.ongoing</code> label to indicate issues currently ongoing.</strong></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div id="using-milestones">
        <h3 id="using-milestones-2">Using Milestones:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-milestones/">GitHub milestones</a> to indicate which issues are to be handled for which milestone by assigning issues to suitable milestones.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Set the deadlines for milestones (in GitHub). Your internal milestones can be set earlier than the deadlines we have set, to give you a buffer.</p>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <tip-box type="important">
          <p>To consider the milestone as 'reached', <strong>you should have <tooltip content="described below">wrapped up</tooltip> the milestone <em>before</em> the tutorial begins. Missed milestones will count against the 'project management' component of your final grade</strong>.</p>
        </tip-box>
        <p><strong>Wrapping up a Milestone</strong>:<br> Here are the conditions to satisfy for a milestone to be considered properly wrapped up:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>A working product tagged with the correct tag (e.g. v1.2) is pushed to the main repo.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>All tests passing on Travis for the version tagged above.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Milestone updated to match the product i.e. all issues completed and PRs merged for the milestone should be assigned to the milestone.<br><img src="/website/admin/images/assigningIssuesToMilestones.png" width="700"></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Milestone closed. If there are incomplete issues or unmerged PRs in the milestone, move them to a future milestone.<br><img src="/website/admin/images/closingMilestones.png" width="700"></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Optionally, issues for the next milestone are assigned to team members (this is not compulsory to do <em>before</em> the tutorial, but we recommend you to do it soon after the tutorial).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Optionally, future milestones are revised based on what you experienced in the current milestone <span class="dimmed"> e.g. if you could not finish all issues assigned to the current milestone, it is a sign that you overestimated how much you can do in a week, which means you might want to reduce the issues assigned to future milestones to match that observation</span>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Doing a 'release' on GitHub is optional for v1.1 and v1.2 but compulsory from v1.3.</p>

    <p>If your team is facing difficulties due to differences in skill/motivation /availability among team members,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>First, do not expect everyone to have the same skill/motivation level as you.</strong> It is fine if someone wants to do less and have low expectations from the module. That doesn't mean that person is a bad person. Everyone is entitled
          to have their own priorities.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Second, don't give up.</strong> It is unfortunate that your team ended up in this situation, but you can turn it into a good learning opportunity. You don't get an opportunity to save a sinking team every day 😃</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Third, if you care about your grade and willing to work for it, you need to take initiative</strong> to turn the situation around or else the whole team is going to suffer. Don't hesitate to take charge if the situation calls for it. By
          doing so, you'll be doing a favor for your team. Be professional, kind, and courteous to the team members, but also be firm and assertive. It is your grade that is at stake. Don't worry about making a bad situation worse. You won't know until
          you try.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Finally, don't feed angry or 'wronged'.</strong> Teamwork problems are not uncommon in this module and we know how to grade so that you will not be penalized for others' low contribution. We can use Git to find exactly what others did.
          It's not your responsibility to get others to contribute.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Given below are some suggestions you can adopt if the project work is not going smooth due to team issues. Note that the below measures can result in some team members doing more work than others and earning better project grades than others. It is
      still better than sinking the whole team together.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Redistribute the work</strong>: Stronger programmers in the team should take over the critical parts of the code.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Enforce stricter integration workflow</strong>: Appoint an integrator (typically, the strongest programmer). His/her job is to maintain the integrated version of the code. He/she should not accept any code that breaks the existing product
          or is not up to the acceptable quality standard. It is up to others to submit acceptable code to the integrator. Note that if the integrator rejected your code unreasonably, you can still earn marks for that code. You are allowed to submit such
          'rejected' code for grading. They can earn marks based on the quality of the code.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>If you have very unreliable or totally disengaged team members</strong> :</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Re-allocate to others any mission-critical work allocated to that person so that such team members cannot bring down the entire team.</li>
      <li>However, do not leave out such team members from project communications. Always keep them in the loop so that they can contribute any time they wish to.</li>
      <li>Furthermore, evaluate them sincerely and fairly during peer evaluations so that they do get the grade their work deserves, no more, no less.</li>
      <li>Be courteous to such team members too. Some folks have genuine problems that prevent them from contributing more although they may not be able tell you the reasons. Just do your best for the project and assume everyone else is doing their best too,
        although their best may be lower than yours.</li>
