  <div>
    <p>Given their lightweight nature, <strong>user stories are quite handy for recording requirements during early requirements gathering</strong>.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>💡 Here are some tips for using user stories for early stages of requirement gathering:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Define the <em>target user</em>:</strong><br> Decide your target user's profile (e.g. a student, office worker, programmer, sales person) and work patterns (e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer with others?).
          A clear understanding of the target user will help when deciding the importance of a user story. You can even give this user a name. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Target user Jean is a university student studying in a non-IT field. She interacts with a lot of people due to her involvement in university clubs/societies. ...</span></li>
        <li><strong>Define the <em>problem scope</em>:</strong> Decide that exact problem you are going to solve for the target user. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Help Jean keep track of all her school contacts</span></li>
        <li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong><br> Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for the target users.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't go into too much details:</strong><br> For example, consider this user story: <code>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.</code><br> When
          discussing this user story, don't worry about what tasks should be considered <em>needs my attention most at the present time</em>. Those details can be worked out later.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't be biased by preconceived product ideas:</strong><br> When you are at the stage of identifying user needs, clear your mind of ideas you have about what your end product will look like.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong><br> When gathering requirements, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil it. Implementation
          details can be discussed later. If a user story turns out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always omit it from the implementation plan.</li>
      </ul>
    </tip-box>
  </div>
</modal>
<panel header="%%:package: User Story examples (from a different product)%%">
  <p><code>As a user I can add a task by specifying a task description only, so that I can record tasks that need to be done ‘some day’.</code><br><code>As a user I can find upcoming tasks, so that I can decide what needs to be done soon.</code><br><code>As a user I can delete a task, so that I can get rid of tasks that I no longer care to track.</code><br><code>As a new user I can view more information about a particular command, so that I can learn how to use various commands.</code><br><code>As an advanced user I can use shorter versions of a command, so that type a command faster.</code></p>

<h4 id="step-2-prioritize-the-user-stories">Step 2: Prioritize the user stories</h4><img src="/website/admin/images/userstories.png" width="250px">
<p>Suggested workflow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Take one use story at a time and get team member opinions about it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Based on the team consensus, put the story (i.e. the piece of paper) onto one of these three piles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>Must-Have</code> : The product will be practically useless to the target user without this feature.</li>
      <li><code>Nice-To-Have</code> : The target user can benefit from this user story significantly but you are not certain if you'll have time to implement it.</li>
      <li><code>Not-Useful</code> : No significant benefit to the target user, or does not fit into the product vision.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="dimmed">If using physical paper to record user stories: After all stories have been put in the above three piles, you can make a record of which stories are in the three piles.</span></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="step-3-record-v20-requirements-in-the-developer-guide">Step 3: Record v2.0 Requirements in the Developer Guide</h4>
<p>Based on your user story categorization in step 1, given project requirements, and the current state of the product, select which user stories you are likely to include in v2.0.</p>
<p>Update the following pages of the Developer Guide:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v10-userstories"><strong>User Stories</strong></trigger>: Give a list of the user stories, including priorities. This can include user stories considered but will not be included in the final product.</li>
  <li>
    <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v10-usecases"><strong>Use Cases</strong></trigger>: Give use cases (textual form) for a few representative user stories that need multiple steps to complete. <span class="dimmed">e.g. Adding a tag to a person (assume the user needs to find the person first)</span></li>
  <li>
    <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v10-nfr"><strong>Non-functional requirements</strong></trigger>:<br> Note: Many of the project constraints mentioned above are NFRs. You can add more. e.g. performance requirements, usability requirements, scalability requirements, etc.</li>
  <li>
    <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v10-glossary"><strong>Glossary</strong></trigger>: Define terms that are worth defining.</li>
  <li>[Optional]
    <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v10-prodsurveys"><strong>Product survey</strong></trigger>: Explore a few similar/related products and describe your findings i.e. Pros, cons, (from the target user's point of view).</li>

                      <p>The system is to be used by Testers, Programmers and System Administrators. Only an administrator can create new users and assign tasks to programmers. Any tester can create a bug report, as well as set the status of a bug report
                        as ‘closed’. Only a programmer can set the state of a bug report to ‘fixed’, but a programmer cannot set the status of a bug report to ‘closed’. Each tester is assigned just one task at a time. A task involves testing of a particular
                        component for a particular customer. Tester must document the bugs they find. Each bug is given a unique identifier. Other information recorded about the bug is component id, severity, date and time reported, programmer who is
                        assigned to fix it, date fixed, date retested and date closed. The system keeps track of which bugs are assigned to which programmer at any given time. It should be able to generate reports on the number of bugs found, fixed and
                        closed e.g. number of bugs per component and per customer; number of bugs found by a particular tester ; number of bugs awaiting to be fixed; number of bugs awaiting to be retested; number of bugs awaiting to be assigned to programmers

                        <p><strong>Explanation</strong>: The given description contains information not relevant to use case modeling. Furthermore, the description is not enough to complete the use case diagram All these are realities of real projects. However,
                          the process of trying to create this use case diagram prompts us to investigate issues such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Is ‘edit bug report’ a use case or editing the bug report is covered by other use cases such as those for setting the status of bug reports? If it is indeed a separate use case, who are the actors of that use case?</li>
                          <li>Does ‘assign task’ simply means ‘assign bug report’ or is there any other type of tasks?</li>
                          <li>There was some mention about Customers and Components. Does the system have to support use cases for creating and maintaining details about those entities? For example, should we have a ‘create customer record’ use case?</li>
                          <li>Which actors can perform the ‘generate report’ use case? Are reports generated automatically by the system at a specific time or generated ‘on demand’ when users request to view them? Do we have to treat different types of reports
                            as different use cases (in case some types of reports are restricted to some types of users)? The above diagram assumes (just for illustration) that the report is generated on demand and only the system admin can generate any
                            report.</li>

              <p>When separating extensions from the MSS, keep in mind that the <strong>MSS should be self-contained</strong>. That is, the MSS should give us a complete usage scenario.</p>
              <p>Also note that it is not useful to mention events such as power failures or system crashes as extensions because the system cannot function beyond such catastrophic failures.</p><img src="/website/book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/details/images/extension.png"

            <p><strong>You can use actor generalization in use case diagrams</strong> using a symbol similar to that of UML notation for inheritance.</p>
            <tip-box>
              <p>📦 In this example, actor <code>Blogger</code> can do all the use cases the actor <code>Guest</code> can do, as a result of the actor generalization relationship given in the diagram.</p><img src="/website/book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/actorGeneralisation.png"
                height="250"></tip-box>
            <tip-box type="tip">
              Do not over-complicate use case diagrams by trying to include everything possible. A use case diagram is a brief summary of the use cases that is used as a starting point. Details of the use cases can be given in the use case descriptions.
            </tip-box>
            <p><strong>Some include ‘System’ as an actor to indicate that something is done by the system itself without being initiated by a user or an external system.</strong></p>
            <tip-box>
              <p>📦 The diagram below can be used to indicate that the system generates daily reports at midnight.</p><img src="/website/book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/systemAsActor.jpg" height="200"></tip-box>
            <p>However, others argue that only use cases providing value to an external user/system should be shown in the use case diagram. For example, they argue that ‘view daily report’ should be the use case and <code>generate daily report</code> is
              not to be shown in the use case diagram because it is simply something the system has to do to support the <code>view daily report</code> use case.</p>
            <p>We recommend that you follow the latter view (i.e. not to use System as a user). Limit use cases for Modeling Behaviors that involve an external actor.</p>
            <p><strong>UML is not very specific about the text contents of a use case.</strong> Hence, there are many styles for writing use cases. For example, the steps can be written as a continuous paragraph. Use cases should be easy to read. Note that
              there is no strict rule about writing all details of all steps or a need to use all the elements of a use case.</p>
            <p><strong>There are some advantages of documenting system requirements as use cases:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Because they use a simple notation and plain English descriptions, they are easy for users to understand and give feedback.</li>
              <li>They decouple user intention from mechanism (note that use cases should not include UI-specific details), allowing the system designers more freedom to optimize how a functionality is provided to a user.</li>
              <li>Identifying all possible extensions encourages us to consider all situations that a software product might face during its operation.</li>
              <li>Separating typical scenarios from special cases encourages us to optimize the typical scenarios.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>One of the main disadvantages of use cases is that they are not good for capturing requirements that does not involve a user interacting with the system.</strong> Hence, they should not be used as the sole means to specify requirements.</p>

          <li>When reviewers are satisfied with the PR, one of the members (usually the team lead or a designated 'maintainer' of the main repo) merges the PR, which brings Jean’s code to the main repo.</li>
          <li>Other members, realizing there is new code in the upstream repo, sync their forks with the new upstream repo (i.e. the main repo). This is done by pulling the new code to their own local repo and pushing the updated code to their own fork.</li>
